We can clone our image from {
   
    -openshift registry
    -dockerStrategy
    -other registry
  }

so that image may be updated anytime , so a conflict to my code may occuring 
so openshift provides ImageStream to provide a consistent refrencing technique for docker image ,
now every time you clone that image you will get latest of same ImageStreamTag or image stream id 


YAML of ImageStream :-

{
    apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
    kind: ImageStream
    metadata:
    name: simple-webapp-docker
}
