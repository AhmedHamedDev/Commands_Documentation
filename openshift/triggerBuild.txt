We need the builds to trigger automatically when making any changes into ur applicatio source code ,
So when developer updates the code repo, code repo should send Msg to notify openshift to build 

so when a message delivered too openshift what openshift do ? 
    1- pull the code 
    2- build docker image 
    3-deploy new version of the app into target environment to make changes accessible to users 

So how it works  ? 

        we can do it using <webhooks> :- which i san event notifiation technique the sends http post request to a predefiend URL
        when an event occurs such as code changed into [github, gitlab, bitbucket,..]

- most of code repos such as [github, gitlab, bitbucket,..] come with built in support for webhooks 

               * github - settings - configurations - send Url <webhook Url>
               * gitlab-repo-settings-integration-paste url <webhook Url>

that <webhook Url> comes from openshift webconsol-configurations - gethub webhook url
notes :- 

  * both instances of urls should be network accessible lets say both public 
  * if local from getlab -----> uncheck  "enable ssl verification" and from settings allow local
